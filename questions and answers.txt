What are constants?

A Ruby constant is like a variable, except that its value is supposed to remain constant for the duration of the program. 
The Ruby interpreter does not actually enforce the constancy of constants, 
but it does issue a warning if a program changes the value of a constant

Why do we use them?

We use constants if we intend to use a variable a number of times in our program. 
That way we reserve a place for it in memory.

How are they different than other ruby variables?

Constants are meant to remain untouched through out the program execution. 
In ruby constants could still be resigned if you persist. Constants return a warning if you try to resign them.
But if you persist you can overwrite or resign them.

How are these two statements different?
     a == ‘hi’	# The double equal sign is a comparison operator which is supposed to turn a boolean.
     a = ‘hi’	# Assigns a the value of 'hi'
